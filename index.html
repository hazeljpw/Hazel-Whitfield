        <!-- ABOUT ME -->
        <div class="glass-bg" id="about">
          <h1 id="sectionTitle">About me</h1>
          <h5><u>Background:</u></h5>
          <p>Born in the Philippines, I migrated to the US in 2015. During my time in the US, I gained experience
            collaborating with a diverse culture. I began my career in Accounting working in a small company as an Entry
            Level Accountant. I worked my way up to a Senior Level Accounting position in a quasi-govermental agency.</p>


          <p>While excelling in the field of accounting, I began to recognize a growing passion for technology and its
            potential to positively impact people's lives. The realization that technology could be a powerful force for
            positive change ignited a desire within me to explore new avenues where I could contribute.</p>

          <pp>As a former accountant, I bring skills such as an analytical mindset, meticulous attention to detail, adept
            risk management, effective communication abilities, and commitment to ethical work practices. I am also eager
            to learn and open to constructive criticism for continuous improvement.</p>

            <h5><u>Values:</u></h5>

            <p>My belief in God is the foundation of my values, influencing how I treat people and approach work. Guided
              by these principles, I prioritize honesty, integrity, and treating others with respect. This commitment to
              ethical conduct contributes to a positive and trustworthy workplace environment, fostering collaboration and
              mutual respect.</p>
            <p>I aspire to contribute these values to a company that shares a commitment to ethical practices, fostering a
              workplace where individuals are respected, and collaborative efforts are valued. I seek an environment that
              aligns with my belief in the importance of integrity and values-driven interactions in achieving successful
              outcomes.</p>
